# Nabu Power Supply Adapter

This adapter goes between a "TOP 60522" open frame power supply and the Nabu mainboard to give an easy and straightforward replacement for the built in power supply; the new one runs on multi voltages. 

Be sure to double check for correct voltages before plugging the mainboard in again!

There is also a jumper connector to connect a 12V DC fan if needed.

The "TOP 60522" has minimum current requirements for proper regulation, so depending on tolerances it might need a load resistor; mine didn't, but I can update the cicuit to include one if needed...
